Study of the effects of the 2021 Greenwood Fire (wildfire) on physical, chemical and biological properties of lakes in Superior National Forest, Minnesota. Funded by the US National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology Ecosystem Science Cluster (RAPID grant). Field work was completed in summer 2022 on 30 lakes (15 burned, 15 control) during 5 monthly visits from May-September. There were several moose sightings.
