Downloaded summary data for entire record (starting May 24); contains daily highs, lows and averages
Changed column names to get rid of special characters. Not entirely clear how variables were calculated (especially precip total variables)
Didn't see anything in user's manual about how variables were calculated
Downloaded quickly

If you download all the data, it takes several minutes despite being relatively small file
This may be preferable for calculating summary variables (15-minute interval data)
