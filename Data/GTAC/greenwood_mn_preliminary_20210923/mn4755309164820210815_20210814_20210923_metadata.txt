    Description
        Abstract: These data products are preliminary burn severity assessments derived from Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2A data. The pre-fire and post-fire subsets included were used to create a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image attempts to portray the variation of burn severity within a fire. The severity ratings are influenced by the effects to the canopy.  The severity rating is based upon a composite of the severity to the understory (grass, shrub layers), midstory trees and overstory trees. Because there is often a strong correlation between canopy consumption and soil effects, this algorithm works in many cases for BAER teams whose objective is a soil burn severity assessment.  It is not, however, appropriate in all ecosystems or fires. It is expected that BAER teams will adjust the thresholds to match field observations to produce a soil burn severity.
        Purpose: These data were created by the USDA Forest Service Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC) to support Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams.

    Access Constraints: Thresholded, preliminary severity estimates (BARC4 and BARC256) are only delivered to BAER teams. Further distribution is at the discretion of the BAER team leader. Pre-imagery, post-imagery, and unthresholded data are publicly available on https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/afm/baer/download.php. Access to pre-imagery and post-imagery may be limited when sensors other than Landsat or other government remote sensing assets are used due to product licensing restrictions.
    Use Constraints:  There are no restrictions on use, except for reasonable and proper acknowledgement of information sources and limitations as preliminary/draft data.

Data Quality Information
    Positional Accuracy
        Horizontal Positional Accuracy
            Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report: Landsat data are terrain corrected using a USGS digital elevation model with less than 1/2 pixel RMS error. Accuracy may vary for other sensors.

        Process Step
            Process Description: These data products are derived from Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2A data. Pre-fire and post-fire scenes are analyzed to create a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image portrays the variation of burn severity within the fire. The pre- and post-fire images are terrain corrected and further processed to convert top of atmosphere reflectance. 
                The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is computed for the pre- and post-fire images using the following formula:
                (NIR Band - SWIR Band) / (NIR Band + SWIR Band) = NBR

                The Differenced NBR is computed to determine severity by subtracting the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR:
                (PreNBR - PostNBR) = dNBR
